CosmiQ is a simple program to view and manage Python libraries.

Made on the 29th of July, 2024 at 4:24 AM

List of vital Libraries, without these the program may not function correctly:
 - tkinter
 - subprocess
 - importlib.metadata
 - setuptools

If you have any issues with the program, check if you have these libraries installed.
The vital libraries are marked with an asterisk * .
Also, you need a working python installation.

I wanted to make it a .exe file, but PyInstaller refuses.
